# R.A.T.T.L.E.
An AI-powered intrusion detection system that uses unsupervised learning, including density-based spatial clustering, and deep learning algorithms to effectively detect anomalies in large sets of network telemetry data. The model is built as an autoencoder that compresses the data into 16-bit chunks for faster and more powerful processing.
